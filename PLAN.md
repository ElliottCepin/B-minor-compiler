# Introduction
This project is being completed alongside heavy usage of Doglas Thain's "Introduction to Compilers and Language Design." Since I do not have an *instructor*, the assignments, exercises, text, and coding conventions are my primary authority. My workflow looks something like this:

Repeat until all assignments are completed and chapters are read:
 - Read Chapter
 - Review Exercises (I haven't decided how many/which I will complete)
 - Perform assignment (if I have read enough chapters to sufficiently perform given task)

Note that the chapter on ARM assembly will be ignored.
