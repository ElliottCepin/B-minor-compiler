# Introduction
This project is being completed alongside heavy usage of Doglas Thain's "Introduction to Compilers and Language Design." Since I do not have an *instructor*, the assignments, exercises, text, and coding conventions are my primary authority. My workflow looks something like this:

Repeat until all assignments are completed and chapters are read:
 - Read Chapter
 - Review Exercises (I haven't decided how many/which I will complete)
 - Perform assignment (if I have read enough chapters to sufficiently perform given task)

Note that the chapter on ARM assembly will be ignored. 

# Assignments
When working on assignments, I will create an ignored spec file that will hold any thoughts or notes about the assignment

# Automation & Testing
I would expect that a professor might provide some means of testing. Whether or not that be the case, I do not have the professor; I will have to make testcases and automate them on my own. This is unfortunate, because it will not have any impact on my progression towards correctly constructing a compiler. On the other hand, it will be good practice scripting and testing.
